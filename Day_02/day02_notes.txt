Explain why we use Tuples for GPS data but Lists for Shopping Carts.

GPS Data uses Tuples because:
- Coordinates (latitude, longitude) are fixed values that shouldn't change
- Tuples are immutable - preventing accidental modification
- A location at (40.7128, -74.0060) should always remain that exact point
- Immutability provides data integrity and safety

Shopping Carts use Lists because:
- Items need to be added, removed, or modified frequently
- Lists are mutable - allowing dynamic updates
- Users constantly change cart contents (add items, remove items, update quantities)
- Flexibility is more important than immutability for this use case
