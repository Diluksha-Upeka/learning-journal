# List had to search through every single number until it reached 10 million
# Time Complexity: O(n) - Linear Time

# Dictionary used a Hash Function (a mathematical formula) to calculate the exact
# memory location of the number 9,999,999 and jumped directly to it.
# Time Complexity: O(1) - Constant Time
# This is why dictionaries are preferred for database lookups.
