Day 06 – Inheritance Notes

- Inheritance lets a class (child/subclass) reuse and extend another class (parent/superclass).
- The child gets the parent’s attributes and methods automatically.

- Syntax: class Child(Parent):
- If you don’t specify a parent, Python uses object as the default parent.

**Initializers and super()
- If the parent class has __init__, call it from the child with super().__init__(...).
- Forgetting super() is a common source of bugs (missing attributes).

**Method overriding
- A child can redefine a method from the parent using the same name.
- Use overriding when behavior should be similar but slightly different.
- If you still want the parent behavior, call super().method_name(...) inside the override.

**Attribute and method lookup
- When you access obj.attr, Python searches:
	child class → parent classes (following MRO) → object.
- If not found anywhere, you get an AttributeError.

**Multiple inheritance (use sparingly)
- A class can inherit from more than one parent: class Child(A, B):
- This increases complexity; only use when there is a clear need.
- Python uses Method Resolution Order (MRO) to decide which parent to use first.

**When to use inheritance
- When multiple classes share common behavior and data.
- When you want to specialize a more general class (BaseShape → Circle, Rectangle).
- Avoid deep inheritance chains (hard to understand and maintain).
