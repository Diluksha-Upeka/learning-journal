# CLASSIFICATION 

# Linear Regression - HOW MUCH
# Logistic Regression - YES or NO (0 or 1)

# Logistic regression first calculates the probability, then applies the threshold to decide the class

# SIGMOID FUNCTION
#--------------------------
# Sigmoid(z) = 1 / (1 + e^(-z))

# Input value (z) can be any real number
# Output value is always between 0 and 1
# Large negative -> Output close to 0
# Large positive -> Output close to 1

# features are measurable properties
# labels are the correct answers

# We give inputs + correct outputs ---> Supervised Learning

# predict_proba() -> confidence level
# predict() -> final decision
